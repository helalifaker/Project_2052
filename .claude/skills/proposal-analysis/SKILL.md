# Proposal Analysis Skill

## Instructions

When analyzing lease proposals in Project Zeta:

1. **Understand the Proposal Type**
   - Identify the rent model (FIXED_ESCALATION, REVENUE_SHARE, or PARTNER_INVESTMENT)
   - Note the negotiation status and key parameters

2. **Financial Viability Assessment**
   - Review projected cash flows across all three periods
   - Analyze cumulative rent vs. revenue ratios
   - Check for negative cash positions or unsustainable trends

3. **Risk Identification**
   - Enrollment dependency risks
   - Interest rate sensitivity
   - Escalation rate impacts over 30 years
   - Zakat and tax implications

4. **Comparison Analysis**
   - When comparing scenarios, highlight key differentiators
   - Use sensitivity analysis data when available
   - Present tornado chart insights for variable impact

5. **Board-Level Summary**
   - Provide executive-level insights
   - Highlight decision-critical metrics
   - Frame recommendations in SAR with proper formatting

## Key Metrics to Analyze

- Net Present Value (NPV)
- Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
- Rent-to-Revenue ratio
- Cash position trajectory
- Break-even points

## Examples

- "Analyze this proposal for financial viability"
- "Compare these two lease scenarios"
- "What are the risks with this revenue share proposal?"
